# Documentation

I decided to use the python programming language to create my websocket in.


### Requirements

In order to run my scripts you must have:

- at least one server/computer with linux installed
- Python 2.7 installed

### Running the program

To run my scripts open a terminal window and run socket-server.py with the command:

   python socket-server.py

After you have done this, open a second terminal and start the client script with the command:

   python client-connect.py

Once you have done this the program should now be running properly.

### Using The Program
